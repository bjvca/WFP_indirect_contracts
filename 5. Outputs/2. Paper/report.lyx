Conditional Contracts in Indirect Local Procurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Since 2004,
 the World Food Programme (WFP) has increasingly recognized its potential to stimulate local market development by facilitating small-scale traders’ and farmer organizations’ access to reliable and profitable markets.
 Building on this commitment,
 WFP introduced the Local and Regional Food Procurement Policy (LRFP) in 2019—
a strategy aimed at engaging private sector actors,
 particularly large-scale traders,
 to enable more cost-effective sourcing while advancing broader development goals such as improved nutrition,
 resilience,
 smallholder incomes,
 livelihoods,
 and gender equality.
 This report analyzes systematically collected stack survey data from farmers and traders in western Uganda to evaluate the extent to which the LRFP policy has contributed to these objectives and fostered transformation within local agricultural value chains.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In crisis situations such as armed conflicts or natural disasters,
 timely food aid plays a critical role.
 It not only prevents famine and acute malnutrition in the short term,
 but also protects households from depleting their assets,
 thereby reducing long-term hardship.
 The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is at the forefront of these efforts,
 leveraging a vast logistics network—
of up to 5,000 trucks,
 80 aircraft and 20 ships in motion daily—
to deliver food assistance on an immense scale,
 reaching 152 million people in 2023 alone 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In war-torn nations like Syria and Yemen (with conflicts beginning in 2011 and 2015,
 respectively),
 WFP has sustained millions of people with staple foods month after month,
 peaking at about 5.6 million recipients per month in Syria and 13 million in Yemen\SpecialChar allowbreak
 during the worst periods of conflict.
 The impact of such timely assistance is evident:
 a famine that emerged in South Sudan in early 2017 was ended within four months due to a concerted large-scale humanitarian response.
 WFP has also been crucial in sudden natural disasters – for instance,
 after the February 2023 earthquake in Syria and Turkey,
 it rapidly provided hot meals and ready-to-eat rations to survivors cut off by the destruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally,
 WFP obtained the food it distributed directly from donor countries.
 Tied aid such as this has faced increasing criticism since the late 20th century for its economic inefficiency and negative impacts on recipient countries.
 The shift towards untied aid gained momentum with international agreements like the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,
 advocating for aid that aligns more closely with the development priorities of recipient countries.
 WFP followed this trend and started relying more and more on Local purchases (that is,
 in the affected country) or regional purchases (that is,
 in a neighboring country or a third country in the region) of the food it needs for its food aid operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda,
 a stable country in a conflict-prone region,
 has become a crucial player in WFP's efforts to combat food insecurity.
 As the largest buyer of food commodities in low- and middle-income countries,
 WFP injected $50 million into Uganda’s economy in 2018,
 purchasing significant quantities of maize,
 sorghum,
 and beans.
 Various WFP initiatives,
 such as the Purchase for Progress (P4P) pilot,
 aim to enhance market access for smallholder farmers,
 improve agricultural outcomes,
 and foster equitable growth within local food markets.
 Despite the positive impacts,
 challenges persist,
 such as for instance higher costs,
 market fragmentation and high quality requirements,
 which compromises the benefits to smallholder farmers.
 Recent policy shifts towards indirect conditional contracts,
 which are agreements between WFP and wholesale maize traders requiring that a portion of procurement be sourced directly from smallholder farmers,
 aim to better integrate these farmers into the supply chain and ensure they benefit more from WFP’s stable demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize,
 one of the most extensively cultivated staple crop in Uganda,
 occupies about 30% of the country's cropped land,
 serving as both a critical food security crop and a vital source of income for farmers.
 The government has prioritized maize production in its agricultural strategy to enhance national food security and support household livelihoods.
 The maize value chain in Uganda involves numerous interconnected actors,
 from agro-input dealers who supply essential inputs like seeds and fertilizers to smallholder farmers,
 to traders and processors who turn the harvested maize into products like flour for consumer purchase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite government efforts to promote modern agricultural practices,
 many farmers continue to rely on traditional methods and face challenges such as access to quality inputs,
 low productivity,
 and inefficient post-harvest handling that leads to significant losses.
 These issues,
 coupled with inefficient market access and processing capabilities,
 stifle the overall competitiveness of Uganda's maize sector.
 Traders and small-scale processors play a crucial role in linking farmers to markets and enhancing market participation,
 even as the sector grapples with challenges in storage,
 transportation,
 and price fluctuations influenced by seasonal and regional dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report utilizes observational data that was collected through careful stratification from about 300 trader and 1300 farmers.
 We also collected qualitative data from wholesalers.
 Extensive exploratory and descriptive analysis will identify patterns in the data,
 while econometric techniques like fixed effects models and matching methods will be applied to rigorously attribute causality and separate the effect of indirect conditional contracts from external influences,
 thereby enhancing the reliability and depth of the findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have been surprisingly few studies on local and regional procurement and virtually none on LRP through the indirect conditional contract modality.
 Note that while emergency aid corresponds to a supply shock for the recipient country,
 the country where the food is procured incurs a demand shock,
 generally due to a single buyer that enters the market with known contracting mechanisms and quality standards.
 The study that is probably closest to ours is

 who examined the effects of local and regional procurement (LRP) of food aid in Uganda through a survey of 120 maize traders,
 highlighting the complex impacts on local markets.
 Their study revealed that while LRP can potentially stimulate local economies,
 it also raises consumer prices and market volatility,
 complicating the benefits for poor consumers and small-scale farmers.

The remainder of this report is structured as follows.
 We begin with an explanation of the new procurement modality,
 focusing on indirect conditional contracting.
 Next,
 we provide an overview of Uganda’s maize sub-sector,
 highlighting the roles of farmers,
 traders,
 and wholesalers within the value chain.
 The methods section then outlines the research questions and describes how these are addressed using stack survey data.
 This is followed by the results,
 starting with a descriptive analysis and then moving to a more analytical section that explores potential causal relationships.
 The report concludes with a summary of key findings and policy recommendations based on the evidence.

 As a result,
 it is a key contributor to the World Food Programme (WFP),
 the world’s largest humanitarian organization,
 which buys more food commodities for its food assistance programs from Uganda than from any other low- and middle-income country.
 In 2018,
 WFP invested 50 million USD in the Ugandan economy and purchased over 188,000 metric tons of local food commodities—
mainly maize,
 sorghum and beans—
through open tendering from large traders

 WFP’s food assistance programs support disadvantaged populations,
 including food-insecure households,
 young children and refugees and internally displaced persons.
 In Uganda,
 these programs help address food insecurity and malnutrition and support the growing refugee population while bolstering the country’s national social protection system.
 This is important given that Uganda is currently Africa’s largest refugee hosting country

Smallholder farmers have been a core focus of WFP’s procurement policies for at least two decades.
 In 2004,
 the “Food Procurement in Developing Countries” policy was initiated,
 recognizing the role WFP had to play in developing markets,
 supporting small traders and farmers’ groups and using procurement to encourage smallholder farmers and farmer groups to enter reliable and lucrative markets

 In 2007,
 WFP’s Home-Grown School Feeding (HGSF) program was launched with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
 once again emphasizing the need for local procurement from small producers.
 Building on the HGSF but greatly expanding its scope and ambition,
 WFP then launched a 20-country pilot of its Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative in the wake of the 2007-08 food price crisis.
 P4P explored procurement modalities with the potential to improve agricultural outcomes and develop country-level food markets in a way that would benefit smallholder farmers

 In Uganda specifically,
 large-scale local procurement by WFP appears to have accentuated price speculation among traders and resulted in an equilibrium where two types of maize quality exist:
 high quality,
 sold to WFP,
 and low quality,
 directed towards the local market

 Using regular contracts and open tendering with large traders resulted in about 50% of the cash (market value) reaching smallholder farmers,

 Uganda was one of the first countries to implement the indirect conditional contracts to procure maize,
 instituted in 2021.
 Conditional indirect contracting generally follow the same principles as traditional contracting,
 where purchases are announced in the form of national tenders that specify quantity and quality.
 However,
 under this type of contract,
 the condition is added that 20% of the total volume of maize provided by traders must be sourced directly from smallholder farmers,
 with evidence of purchase (traceability evidence).
 This conditional contract is the focus of this study.

Context and description of maize value chains in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is one of the most widely cultivated staple crops in Uganda,
 serving both as a vital food security crop and a key source of income for farmers.
 Recognizing its importance,
 the government has prioritized maize production as part of its agricultural strategy to support household livelihoods and strengthen national food security.
 Maize accounts for approximately 30% of the total cropped land in Uganda,
 making it the most extensively grown crop,
 followed by beans at 15% (Uganda Annual Agricultural Survey,
 2018).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical maize value chain in Uganda involves a network of interconnected actors.
 At the upstream level,
 agro-input dealers supply essential inputs such as improved seeds and fertilizers to smallholder farmers.
 These farmers,
 in turn,
 cultivate maize by combining these inputs with land and labor.
 Once harvested,
 a marketable surplus is sold to traders,
 who transport the grain to wholesalers or directly to large processors.
 Wholesalers generally sell to large processors.
 Farmers may also take part of the maize they consume themselves to small processors.
 Processors then transform the raw maize into final products,
 such as maize flour,
 which is distributed to retailers and ultimately purchased by consumers.

Most farmers in Uganda continue to rely on traditional farming methods with limited use of modern agricultural inputs.
 While some purchase improved seed varieties,
 such as hybrids or open-pollinated varieties (OPVs),
 many still depend on saved seeds from previous harvests,
 constraining potential yield improvements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Despite government efforts to promote input use,
 challenges related to affordability and accessibility persist.
 Agro-input dealers,
 primarily based in towns and trading centers,
 supply essential inputs such as improved seeds,
 fertilizers,
 pesticides,
 and farming tools.
 However,
 rural farmers often struggle to access high-quality inputs due to distance,
 cost barriers,
 and supply chain inefficiencies.
 Additionally,
 concerns over counterfeit or substandard products further discourage investment in improved technologies,
 as studies have shown that input quality issues are a significant deterrent for farmers

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of traditional farming methods,
 maize productivity remains low,
 with average farm yields of about 600 kg per acre,
 considerably lower than the potential yields reported by research stations,
 which range from 730 kg to 1,820 kg per acre 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fermont2011estimating,gourlay2019new"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore,
 harvesting in Uganda is largely manual,
 and post-harvest handling remains a significant challenge.
 Farmers typically dry maize under the sun before shelling and storing it,
 but inadequate drying techniques and poor storage facilities lead to high post-harvest losses.
 Common storage methods include traditional granaries and polypropylene bags,
 though both are vulnerable to pest infestations and moisture buildup,
 further deteriorating grain quality.
 These post-harvest inefficiencies contribute to reduced market value and increased vulnerability to seasonal price fluctuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Market access is another key challenge for maize farmers.
 Many smallholder farmers sell maize through informal channels,
 including farmgate sales to itinerant traders who aggregate maize in trading centers and small towns.
 Small traders,
 often using bicycles or motorbikes (boda-bodas),
 play a crucial role in linking farmers to markets,
 yet their capacity is constrained by transportation limitations,
 storage capacity challenges,
 credit constraints and unpredictable demand.

The role of traders is often contested,
 and indeed many development interventions supported by NGOs try to

\end_inset

.
 This is because traders,
 both small and large,
 also engage to some extent in arbitrage to capitalize on price seasonality,
 buying up maize grain from farmers immediately post harvest when prices are low and selling during the lean season when maize is scarce and prices are high 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "van2015inter,burke2019sell"

 At the same time,
 research also shows that traders enhance market participation,

The primary goal of the study is to assess the overall impact of WFP entering the market and implementing the indirect conditional contracting modality.
 We will thus look at the impact of the policy on maize value chain transformation or upgrading.
 Within this broader goal,
 our study poses the following research questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does WFP's indirect conditional tendering approach lead to reliable output markets and how does this affect market participation,
 technology adoption,
 production and welfare outcomes for actors involved in the value chains?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the presence of WFP with its condition affect value chain inclusivity and equity?
 That is,
 are there changes in which actors participate in the value chains and which actors extract most of the rents when WFP enters the market with conditionality?
 Do marginalized populations get excluded when WFP starts procuring large quantities of maize?
 Does it affect seasonality?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to looking at the impact of the policy,
 we will also investigate potential general equilibrium or spillover effects of the policy.
 In particular,
 the indirect conditional contracting may drive up prices in the area,
 such that farmers that are not linked to WFP through a trader are also affected.
 Analysis of spillover effects may also be informative to answer the following question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Does the indirect conditional contracting modality have additional effects over and above the effect of a significant buyer entering the market (without conditionality).

\begin_layout Subsection
Data and identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study took place in Western and Central Uganda (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 Maize cultivation plays a vital role in the agricultural landscape of Western and Central Uganda.
 In these regions,
 maize is widely grown by smallholder farmers who rely on it for household consumption,
 income generation,
 and food security.
 Additionally,
 the growing demand for maize from urban markets and agro-industrial processors (both for consumption in Uganda or neighboring countries) has increased its commercial value,
 encouraging investments in improved production practices and inputs and in storage,
 handling and aggregation midstream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The survey for the study of conditional contracts aimed to gather data from three distinct types of actors:
 smallholder farmers,
 small traders who act as intermediaries between these farmers and large suppliers,
 and the large suppliers that are supplying WFP.
 In a first step,
 farmers were selected randomly after stratifying them into three groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Group 1:
 Farmers residing in two districts (Kabarole and Hoima) where the WFP was not actively procuring maize through large buyers.
 Farmers in these two districts were randomly selected in two stages:
 first villages 50 villages were selected from a list of all villages,
 with sampling probabilities proportional to the number of households living in the village.
 Next,
 in each village 10 households were randomly selected from the list obtained from the village headquarters.
 This group will also be referred to as the control group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Group 2:
 Farmers who live in districts with characteristics similar to those in Group 1,
 but where maize is procured from farmers under the indirect conditional contract modality.
 Specifically,
 we sample from four districts:
 Kasese,
 Kyegegwa,
 Kiryandongo,
 and Masindi.
 Kasese and Kyegegwa are located in the southwestern corner of the study area near Lake George and border Kabarole district.
 Kiryandongo and Masindi lie in the northern part of the study area,
 at the northeastern tip of Lake Albert,
 adjacent to Hoima district.
 In these districts,
 farmers are sampled from lists submitted to WFP by wholesalers,
 as part of the contractual requirement to document purchases directly from farmers.
 This group will also be referred to as the indirect contracts or treatment group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Group 3:
 Farmers from the same four districts as group 2,
 but who are not on the traceability list of WFP linked suppliers.
 In particular,
 the interview protocol stipulated that nearest neighbor of each Group 2 farmer also needed to be interviewed.

In the analysis,
 could we look at direct differences between these treated and non-treated?

\begin_layout Standard
The primary identification strategy relies on comparing average outcomes across the three farmer groups for farmer-level indicators,
 and across two trader groups for trader-level outcomes.
 At the farmer level,
 we estimate the impact of WFP’s procurement through the indirect conditional contract modality by comparing farmers in treatment areas (Group 2) to those in control areas (Group 1).
 To explore potential spillover effects,
 we compare outcomes between farmers in Group 2 to those in the same area but not directly liked to WFP linked traders (Group 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the groups we specify are likely to be only proxies to the latent variables we would need to answer the research questions in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 For instance,
 some farmers in Group 1 may in fact be selling to traders linked to WFP through the indirect conditional contracting modality.
 Conversely,
 not all farmers in Group 2 necessarily sold to WFP-linked buyers in the season under analysis,
 as inclusion in this group was based on having appeared on a procurement list in any season.
 Similarly,
 farmers in Group 3 may have indirect exposure to WFP,
 since sellers were only required to register 20 percent of their suppliers to comply with the contract’s conditionality.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
From group 2,
 approximately 23% reported selling directly to WFP or through a connected trader.
 Among spillover farmers (group 3),
 this figure is about 12%.
 In contrast,
 no farmers in control areas reported any sales to WFP.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 because WFP operated exclusively through the conditional contracting modality,
 it is not possible to isolate the effect of conditionality from the broader impact of engagement with a large,
 stable buyer—
an important and policy-relevant distinction.
 Some of these limitations will be further addressed in a separate section by complementing the group-based comparisons with data on farmers’ and traders' actual transactions with WFP-linked buyers (Section

Survey data were collected on general household characteristics of farmers and traders,
 including welfare and food security indicators.
 The primary focus,
 however,
 was on marketing behavior.
 We gathered detailed information on farmers’ maize sales following both the first and second agricultural seasons of 2023,
 and on maize cultivation during the first and second season of 2023 and the first season of 2024.
 For traders,
 data was collected on both purchase and sales transactions for the first and second season of 2023.
 Additional data was gathered on actors’ core business activities:
 for farmers,
 this included agricultural technology use and labor inputs;
 for traders,
 this encompassed handling and storage practices,
 as well as access to finance.

The impact of reliable output markets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main reasons why WFP initiated the indirect conditional contacts modality (and local and regional procurement modalities more in general) is the assumption that linking smallholder farmers to a large credible buyer creates a reliable and predictable market for them.
 Indeed,
 output market uncertainty has been found to be a key constraint to smallholder market participation,
 which in turn discourages investment in commercial agriculture and intensification

 find that Foreign Direct Investment in various large dairy processing plants in southwester Uganda created a reliable market for raw milk that led to upgrading across the entire value chain.
 In this section,
 we trace this impact pathway by first testing if indirect conditional contracts are correlated to market participation.
 We the look for associations between indirect contracting and investment in technologies and practices.
 Finally,
 we look at some production related outcomes.

A first outcome we look at is the use of chemicals.
 Use of pesticides,
 herbicides and fungicides is surprisingly high in Uganda.
 Most farmers use pesticides against fall armyworm and maize stem borers.
 We see that in the control group,
 just under 60 percent of farmers are using some kind of chemical on a randomly selected maize plot.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We did not ask about adoption on all maize plots,
 but instead asked farmers to enumerate all plots and then randomly selected one plot on which detailed questions on technology adoption were asked.
 This is done to save costs,
 as we expect that inputs and practices used on plots are highly correlated within households,
 so surveying more plots does not yield a lot of new information.
 As the plot was chosen randomly,
 plot level outcomes provide an unbiased estimate for household level outcomes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This is slightly lower in the indirect and spillover groups.
 It may be that stricter quality standards refrain farmers from using excessive amounts of chemicals.

 we look at use of improved maize seed varieties obtained from a trusted source (as opposed to farmer saved seed).
 Adoption of improved seed varieties is in line with expectations.

 illustrates that farmers in Uganda are not in a habit of using fertilizer.
 Only about 10 percent of farmers apply DAP and organic fertilizer,
 and this does not seem to be correlated to exposure to the policy,
 either directly or indirectly.
 For Urea,
 we do see that for farmers that live in areas affected by the policy,
 adoption improves substantially.

It is important to acknowledge that these figures may be somewhat inflated due to the inclusion criterion that required farmers to have cultivated maize in at least one season.
 Nonetheless,
 the key point is the observed distinction between the control group and those in the spillover and indirect contracting groups.
 Over time,
 even as the overall proportion declines,
 the data increasingly indicate that farmers influenced by the policy are more likely to continue growing maize.
\end_layout

Next,
 the table turns to production.
 We see a sharp reduction in production in the first season of 1014.
 This was caused by erratic rainfall,
 where it rained early but stooped,
 causing seeds to not germinate and farmers needed to replant.
 For the remainder of the season,
 there was inadequate rain until the critical stage of tasseling.
 In the first season of 2023,
 we get the expected pattern where lowest average production is found in the control areas and highest production in the indirect conditional contract subgroup.
 In the second season of 2023 average production in the control area is slightly higher.
 However,
 in all seasons,
 largest quantities are produced in the indirect conditional contract group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining plot size and production to obtain yields,
 we find that overall yield reductions in the first season of 2024 are substantial,
 but mitigated somewhat by the reduction in plot size.
 We now also find that average productivity in the control group in is lowest in across seasons.
 Yields in the spillover and indirect conditional contract groups also seem similar.

 brings a slightly different perspective on maize productivity by examining how it evolves over time across the different groups.
 In the figure,
 the vertical axis displays changes in production between consecutive seasons.
 With data spanning three seasons,
 the figure thus captures two changes:
 the change from the first to the second season of 2023 (indicated by circles) and from the second season of 2023 to the first season of 2024 (indicated by triangles).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the first and second seasons of 2023 (23A–23B) there is no change in average quantity of maize produced in the control group.
 Similarly,
 for this group,
 the average area from which this quantity was obtained remained the same,
 leading us to conclude that productivity was stable in this group.
 For the indirect conditional contracting group as well as the spillover farmers,
 production also remained the same on average.
 However,
 for these groups,
 the area on which maize was grown declined,
 leading us to conclude that productivity increased between the first and second season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the second season of 2023 and the first season of 2024 (23B-24A),
 all groups experience significant declines in both production and area used for maize.
 However,
 at least for the spillover group,
 the reduction in production is smaller than the reduction for the control,
 while the reduction in plot size is larger than for the control.
 As such,
 while productivity reduced for both groups,
 reduction in productivity is largest in the control group.

 This suggests that the policy does not only draw traders into the market (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Market-participation"

caps "false"

nolink "false"

\end_inset

),
 it may also incentivize greater investment in aggregation,
 processing,
 or transport capacity,
 thereby amplifying market throughput.
 The growing divergence in trade volumes across seasons reinforces the idea that WFP’s procurement modality can stimulate scaling behaviors among intermediaries,
 potentially improving efficiency in the maize value chain.

Commodity flows
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous section showed that the policy was associated with increased production and higher volumes handled.
 In this section,
 we take a closer look at commodity flows within the value chain.
 Specifically,
 from the trader’s perspective,
 we examine how the origins and destinations of traded maize have shifted over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explore these dynamics,
 we begin with trader-level data.
 In addition to collecting information on the quantities of maize procured (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Production"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 we asked traders to report the origin of their purchases as a share of total volume.
 Similarly,
 traders were also asked to indicate the distribution of their sales across different buyer types,
 expressed as percentage shares.
 This information is summarized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Commodity-flows"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure illustrates that the majority of maize procured by traders—
approximately 65 percent—
comes directly from farmers,
 with this share being consistent across both treatment and control groups.
 Fellow traders also represent a significant source,
 with a slightly higher share observed in policy-exposed areas compared to the control group (24 percent versus 20 percent).
 In addition,
 traders operating in areas where the policy was implemented source more maize from markets than their counterparts in control areas.
 Notably,
 the volume procured from cooperatives is three times higher in treatment areas than in control areas.
 Qualitative insights suggest that this difference may stem from the policy’s requirement for farmer registration,
 a process that is often more straightforward when dealing with cooperatives,
 which typically maintain existing farmer registries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the downstream side,
 most maize is sold to wholesalers not linked to WFP.
 In areas affected by the policy,
 a similar share is also sold to other downstream traders.
 Notably,
 in control areas,
 a large portion of sales is recorded under "other buyers"—
a residual category used when reported shares did not sum to 100 percent.
 As expected,
 traders in control areas rarely sell to WFP,
 either directly or through WFP-affiliated wholesalers.
 In contrast,
 approximately 10 percent of maize traded in the treatment areas is supplied to WFP.

Price margin analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Central to many value chain studies is the question of how rents are distributed over different value chain actors.
 A convenient way to illustrate this is by price spread plots,
 that plot prices received by the actor upstream (eg the farmer) against prices received by the actor downstream (eg the trader).
 One can then plot a 45 degree line,
 were prices paid to upstream actors are equal to prices received from downstream actors.
 As such,
 points above the 45 degree line represent transactions were the downstream actor earns a positive margin,
 while points below the 45 degree line are instances where a loss is incurred as commodities are sold at lower prices than at which they were bought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by using data at the trader level.
 Traders were asked about both prices at which they buy maize (mostly from farmers) and prices at which they sell maize further downstream (mostly to wholesale traders - see Section

 plots observations for traders operating in control areas in red,
 and observations for farmers operating in areas exposed to the policy in green.
 As can be seen,
 most points are above the 45 degree lines,
 though there also seem to be occasions where the price at which traders (reportedly) bought maize is lower than the price at which they sold.
 While some of these traders may have made a loss,
 some if it will also be measurement error since it may be hard for traders to name a single average price over an entire season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deal with overplotting,
 we added contour plots with the same color coding to figure.
 For the control group,
 density is highest at points corresponding to a farm gate price of about UGX550 per kilogram of maize and a sales price of about UGX725 per kilogram,
 leading to a trader margin of about UGX175 per kilogram of maize.
 For traders working in areas where the policy was implemented,
 density is highest to the southeast of the control density plot.
 In particular,
 in these areas traders pay about UGX625 per kilogram,
 while traders sell onward for about UGX700,
 leading to a trader margin of about UGX125 per kilogram.
 Note that compared to the control areas,
 farmers get more at the farmgate,
 while consumers are likely to pay less.
 This seems to suggest that value chains are more efficient in areas where WFP is procuring.

 shows that in areas where WFP was active with Indirect conditional contracting,
 intermediaries capture less of the rents than in control ares.
 For example,
 in the first season of 2023,
 farmers sold maize at about UGX800 per kg,
 while traders sold at about 875,
 implying a margin of about 10 percent.
 In the control areas,
 farmer sell at about 750,
 while traders sell at 900,
 implying a margin of 20 percent.
 We also see that the margin reduces with overall price levels.
 In the second season of 2023,
 farmers in the treatment areas sold at 650,
 while traders sold at 775,
 implying a 20 percent margin;
 in control areas the margin increase to 36 percent.

\begin_layout Standard
The increase in price may be a direct effect of increased prices and quantities demanded by a significant and credible buyer.
 However,
 there are many other indirect pathways through which the policy may indirectly increase prices.
 One such indirect pathway would be that the entry of a large buyer leads to market entry by traders.
 We already established in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Market-participation"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 that the policy seems positively related to competition.
 The increased competition among traders could then be responsible for (part of the) price increase at the farmer level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test if competition among traders mediates the impact of an intervention on the price received by farmers,
 we use structural equation modeling,
 which includes techniques like path analysis and mediation analysis.
 Mediation analysis helps in understanding how an independent variable (in this case,
 indirect conditional contracting) influences a dependent variable (price received by farmers) through a mediator variable (the level of competition proxied by the number of traders in the area).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mediation analysis involves the joint estimation of two regression equations.
 First,
 the intervention is regressed on the mediator variable.
 In a second regression,
 two explanatory variables are used (the mediator and the intervention indicator) to explain the outcome (in our case the price farmers receive).
 This allows one to separate the total effect of the intervention into a direct effect (which is the effect of indirect conditional contacting on the farmgate price while controlling for trader entry) and an indirect effect (which is the effect of indirect contractin on trader entry multiplied by the effect of trader entry on farmgate prices while controlling for the indirect contracting).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We again perform such an analysis first using only trader level data.
 In particular,
 using farm gate prices that traders report to be paying to farmers,
 we find a total effect of the policy of UGX

 and a negligible mediated effect (

\end_layout

\end_inset

),
 the latter being not statistically different from zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We repeat this analysis by combining trader level and farmer level data.
 To do so,
 we need to create a measure of competition at farmer level.
 We do this by calculating the average of the responses provided by the traders,
 and use as weights the inverse distance between the farmer and the trader.
 Running the analysis then at the farmer level gives us a total effect of UGX

 In this case both direct and indirect effects are significantly different from zero.
 These findings suggest that the intervention not only directly increases the price received by farmers but also does so indirectly by enhancing competition among traders.

\begin_layout Subsection
Seasonality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most farmers typically sell most of their harvest immediately after harvesting.
 Over time,
 as stocks dwindle,
 less maize is brought to the market.
 During the leans season and especially immediately before the harvest of the subsequent season,
 more maize is bought than sold.
 These demand and supply patterns result in seasonal price movements in maize prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These cyclical price movements can be large,
 with prices often more than doubling over time.
 For poor farmers that do not have the capacity to engage in inter-temporal arbitrage,
 this can lead to so called sell-low buy high patterns,
 where farmers sell maize at low prices only to buy back similar amounts of maize later in the season at significantly high prices

 argue that farmers face a double whammy as in addition to the price effects,
 traders are also likely to pass transaction costs to the farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important question therefore is whether the indirect conditional contracting modality increases of reduces seasonality in prices.
 If WFP purchases target low prices and writes out tenders immediately post harvest (and potentially distributes food aid during the lean season),
 its activities could have counter cyclical effects.
 However,
 if WFP faces delays in procurement due to administrative reasons,
 or if traders speculate on WFPs purchase,
 price variation could increase.

 uses farmer level data to look at seasonality in volumes entering the market and prices.
 Interestingly,
 we do not find that quantities sold are highest immediately after harvest.
 Especially in the second season,
 farmers seem to hold on to their maize until April or May.
 There is some suggestive evidence supporting the hypothesis that farmers in the indirect conditional contacting group hold on longer to their maize.
 For instance,
 in the first season of 2023,
 volumes marketed in this group rise steadily to peak in November.
 in the second season,
 the peak is May.
 Patterns are less clear for the other groups.
 In the fist season,
 there is peak among spillover farmers early on in September.
 In the second season,
 there is an unusual uptick in sales in April in the control group.

Prices seem to remain fairly stable immediately after harvest.
 There is a notable increase in prices in the first season of 2023 in November,
 which is also the month when sales peak in the Indirect conditional contract group.
 Interestingly,
 the increase in prices is highest in the group of farmers that are linked to WFP buyers,
 and lowest in the control group.
 Overall,
 and in both seasons,
 prices reported by farmers that are directly linked to WFP generally report higher prices.
 This seems to suggest that WFP purchases indeed led to some degree of price inflation.

\begin_layout Subsection
Inclusivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important concern raised by WFP is whether the benefits arising from indirect conditional contracts reach vulnerable groups,
 such as women and youth.
 Additionally,
 one of the core objectives of the project is to ensure that smallholder farmers are able to benefit from WFP’s procurement activities.
 In this section,
 we examine whether the impact of these contracts differs across groups,
 with a particular focus on farm-gate prices as the key outcome variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess inclusivity,
 we asked traders to estimate the proportion of their farmer-suppliers who are women,
 youth,
 and smallholders.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Gender-of-farmer"

\end_inset

,
 approximately 30 percent of sellers are women,
 with a slightly higher share observed in areas where the policy is implemented.
 A similar share—
around 30 percent—
of sellers are classified as youth,
 with little variation between treated and comparison areas.
 Regarding smallholder farmers,
 traders report a notable difference:
 in areas where the policy is in place,
 nearly half of the sellers are smallholders,
 suggesting that the intervention may be enhancing participation among this target group.

We now turn to pricing outcomes across different farmer groups,
 using data on individual sales from the first season of 2023.
 To assess potential disparities,
 we analyze transaction-level prices through simple regressions that examine the interaction between farmer characteristics—
such as gender,
 age,
 and farm size—
and treatment status.
 The results reveal a significant overall effect of the policy on the prices farmers receive.
 However,
 we find no evidence of differential effects by gender or age,
 suggesting that concerns about the policy disproportionately benefiting male farmers or excluding youth may be unfounded.
 On the other hand,
 the analysis indicates that the policy’s core objective of improving outcomes for smallholder farmers has not yet been fully realized.

Conclusion and Way Forward
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study set out to assess the impact of indirect conditional contracts implemented by the World Food Programme (WFP) in Uganda,
 with a specific focus on their role in transforming the maize value chain.
 Our analysis was guided by four core research questions:
 (1) What is the impact of the conditional contract on key outcomes—
price realization,
 mount sold,
 household income and other welfare indicators—
of actors along the value chain,
 especially for smallholder farmers and small maize traders?
 (2) Do conditional contracts create access to reliable markets and result in value chain transformation or upgrading?
 (3) Does the presence of a formal/institutional buyer in an area (e.g.
 a WFP-affiliated trader or contract scheme) indirectly improve outcomes for nearby smallholders and traders who are not directly contracted?
 (4) What are the challenges or barriers faced with respect to conditional contracts?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these questions,
 we collected rich,
 stratified data from over 1,300 farmers and nearly 300 traders from six districts in Western and Central Uganda.
 Stratification was done conditional on how farmers and traders were likely to be exposed to the indirect conditional contract programme.
 In a first group,
 farmers that were connected to a WFP buyer are included.
 In a second group,
 we interviewed their neighbors.
 A third group was in a district where WFP was not active.
 For traders,
 we only differentiated between traders working in areas where WFP is active versus districts where they are not.
 We then attempt to learn about the impact by comparing the groups.
 We applied both descriptive and econometric techniques—
including fixed effects models and mediation analysis—
to disentangle the effects of the procurement policy from other factors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that farmers in areas exposed to the policy were significantly more likely to participate in markets and to sell larger quantities of maize.
 They also cultivated larger areas of maize and adopted improved seed varieties and,
 to a lesser extent,
 fertilizer.
 The policy also led to higher prices for farmers and lower margins for traders,
 suggesting a more efficient value chain.
 Structural equation modeling revealed that part of the price increase was directly due to the policy,
 while part was mediated through enhanced competition among traders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traders in policy-affected areas handled significantly more maize,
 indicating improved aggregation and possibly greater investments in storage and transport infrastructure.
 They also sourced more from cooperatives and engaged more frequently with WFP,
 signaling that the policy may be reinforcing more formal and traceable sourcing arrangements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The policy may also influence price seasonality,
 with some evidence that farmers in treated areas delay sales to benefit from higher prices later in the season.
 This has implications for both farmer incomes and consumer access.
 Despite WFP’s commitment to inclusivity,
 the policy did not result in significantly different price effects across gender or age groups.
 There was also no different impact on small farmers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next steps in this research involves agreeing on a limited number of outcomes that we/WFP feel important and then apply more formal analysis to be able to assign causality to the treatment and to also tie associations more the the conditional contacting (instead of conflating impact with simply the presence of WFP).
 In particular,
 we propose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
run regression analysis with controls,
 starting with controls for north and south.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
dropping the control and treating the spillover farmers as controls for treated farmers.
 This is more suggestive of the impact of conditional contracts as in both cases now farmers are exposed to the significant buyer.
 Note that we can block on pairs to get rid of pair all characteristics that would be the same for both of these farmers (like distance to trader etc)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
repeat analysis for subgroups of farmers that are actually selling to WFP as the treatment variable.
 If the effect becomes bigger,
 that would indicate any effect really comes from the policy.
 This can also be done for traders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If we link farmer and trader data,
 we have a many-to-many network.
 Can we do something with this?
 Eg for each trader look at differences between connected farmers and for each farmer look at difference between connected traders?
 Like in our gender paper?
